like Betadine \u00d2 antiseptic solution have demonstrated [ 99.99% activity against both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses including Ebola, MERS, SARS coronavirus, influenza and HFMD viruses (Enterovirus 71 and Coxsackievirus A16).","Simple mathematical model was used to predict the characteristics of the epidemic caused by coronavirus 2019-nCoV in mainland China.","The immunogenicities of five forms of MERS-CoV S glycoprotein in mice were compared in this study.","Bats represent a natural reservoir for several pathogens including Ebola virus, Hendra virus, rabies virus and SARS and MERS coronaviruses.","These guidelines reflect our current understanding of MERS-CoV at the time of publication and the unique situation of the Korean MERS-CoV outbreak.","Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus have been associated with spontaneous abortion, fetal growth retardation, and maternal and neonatal mortality (148) (149) (150) .","It affects all individuals whatever their comorbidities, age, and adherence to preventive measures against respiratory infections including use of face mask, hand hygiene, social distancing, and vaccination.","In conclusion, our data indicate that 2 or 3 nasopharyngeal samples are required to ensure the highest yield of positive results for MERS-CoV.","Coronavirus and enteroviruses/ rhinoviruses were the most common viruses associated with illness.","The pleomorphism of coronaviruses makes these viruses difficult to identify on a strictly morphological basis, and some of the electronmicrographs in the literature cast some doubt as to whether they are indeed coronaviruses.Paramyxoviruses, with the notable exception of canine distemper virus, are not known to cause intestinal infections.Parvoviruses are well-known enteropathogens as exemplified by feline panleukopenia and a similar syndrome recently recognized in puppies [32] .","Airway administration of antiviral nucleic acids has also been shown to be effective for countering influenza virus A [46, 47] and SARS-CoV [66, 67] in animal models of the infections.The persistent risk of emergence of highly pathogenic respiratory viruses remains concerning, and the lessons learned from the outbreak of the SARS-CoV pandemic of 2002/2003 were valuable.","This study also suggests that a preventive strategy targeting either RV-A or especially RV-C, and the inflammatory response associated with these viruses, might help to prevent at least some types of childhood asthma.","While influenza A virus has generated some of the highest morbidity rates following maternal infection, coronavirus outbreaks have also been associated with similar outcomes in mothers and neonates following mid-gestation infection.","Veterinarians should work with physicians to provide education and preventive measures to humans in order to reduce the likelihood of zoonoses transmission.","Bovine coronavirus was most prevalent and significantly associated with M. haemolytica, suggesting a potential interplay between both pathogens.","It is interesting that CoV has not been detected in insects, but that the typical reservoir hosts-bats for alpha-and beta-CoV and birds for gamma-CoV-are largely insect feeding.","Preventive measures are also important, such as vaccinations, hand-washing and isolation of the affected individuals in hospitals and long-term care facilities.","Patients may also have symptoms mimicking an infectious process, which is actually caused by hypersensitivity, especially rhinovirus and coronavirus acting directly as allergens, eliciting an IgE elevated response.","Recent developments allowing manipulation of the large and complicated genome of IBV (Casais et al., 2001) , a coronavirus like the SARS virus, may also help identify additional viral immunomodulators, and hopefully elucidate their mode of action (Casais et al., 2005; Hodgson et al., 2006) .","Mechanistic studies are needed to move beyond what has been learned from epidemiologic studies to develop new biomarkers and related preventive and therapeutic approaches to improving outcomes of acute respiratory illness in persons with multiple chronic conditions.","When formulated with SARS coronavirus vaccine, Advax reduced the risk of lung eosinophilic immunopathology, suggesting that it may be beneficial for use in respiratory virus vaccines, e.g., against SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome and respiratory syncytial virus, where the risk of vaccine-enhanced lung immunopathology is a major concern.","As the MERS-CoV epidemic continues to evolve, vaccine and specific antiviral agents against MERS-CoV are urgently needed.","This will be particularly useful to counter emerging pathogens and serious outbreaks such as have been caused by EBOV and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.","Korea is still under suffering of the Covid-19 pandemic and many peoples who live in Korea are still on panic Many news and social medias have produced the related news \uf0de and comments based on unscientific facts.","It has been previously demonstrated that influenza pseudotype particle neutralization assays correlate with other classical serological assays (Temperton et al, 2007 ; Alberini et al,  CAVV is the first mosquito nidovirus and represents the prototype species of a family in the order Nidovirales that includes features distinct from those established for the Arteriviridae, Roniviridae, and Coronaviridae.","Although there was no evidence that HCP at the NMC were infected with MERS-CoV, a postoutbreak survey revealed that a substantial proportion of HCP did not take appropriate action while infection-related events occurred during patient care.","Similar to epidemics caused by new strains of influenza, SARS coronavirus is most likely to originate from animal species.","Thus, it is imperative to focus future research on the health effects of nano-scale pollutants so that preventive strategies and regulatory guidelines can be developed to reduce exposure and improve human health.","This work demonstrates the power of structure-based approaches in the design of broad-spectrum antiviral compounds with roughly equipotent activity against coronaviruses and enteroviruses.","The new respiratory viruses or viral strains include influenza A virus H5N1 and H1N1, MPV, SARS-, NL63and HKU1-CoV, HBoV, HRV-C and -D and the possible respiratory pathogens, KI-and, WU-PyV and TTV [13, 14, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] .","New animal and human CoVs are constantly emerging or reemerging, as there are animal reservoirs that maintain them, including bats and birds present in high numbers and with high mobility.","Interventional studies addressing the effectiveness of preventive measures are needed.","As we live in ever-increasing populations and become increasingly mobile so it is inevitable that new viruses, such as SARS-CoV, will appear.","The overwhelming majority of reported MERS-CoV cases from SA during July-August 2015 had documented exposures to healthcare settings or to individuals with MERS-CoV infection.","Our study indicated circovirus and an adenovirus related to Human Adenovirus C were present in South American fur seals.","The most common symptoms associated with but not unique to coronaviruses were chills, headache, malaise, cough, sputum production, sore throat, and nasal congestion; dyspnea was more common in the older group, and myalgia was more common in the younger group.","Stigma and hardiness influence mental health both directly and also indirectly via stress in nurses working at government-designated hospitals during a MERS-CoV epidemic.","Recent developments allowing manipulation of the large and complicated genome of infectious bronchitis virus [240] , a coronavirus like the SARS virus, may also help identify additional viral immunomodulators and hopefully elucidate their mode of action [241, 242] .","SARS is a new severe infectious disease in humans, caused by a coronavirus.","Their ongoing importance epidemiologically requires continued surveillance and research into additional preventive measures.","In lieu of a full-length coronavirus cDNA clone capable of generating infectious transcripts, coronavi-rus DI RNAs are being used to study the mechanisms of recombination in this virus family.","Our finding of MERS-CoV RNA on environmental samples within our ICU shows that the viral material may contaminate fomites and can be a theoretical cause of nosocomial infections.","The reported data on confirmed cases and fatalities from SARS-CoV-2 indicates highly significant differences in the age-specific and sex-specific rates of morbidity and mortality from the COVID-19Pandemic in the Republic of Korea (ROK) and China.","CoV-229E can remain infectious on environmental surfaces, and potentially poses a biohazard by contact transmission.","Lastly, wherever possible, adequate disease surveillance measures aimed at intensively farmed livestock in newly developed clearings juxtaposed to intact natural habitats and in locations, such as wetmarkets, where wild caught animals are held in close-proximity to domesticated species, could provide early warnings of outbreaks such as Nipah virus and SARS coronavirus (Chua, Goh et al., 1999; Drosten, Gunther et al., 2003)
