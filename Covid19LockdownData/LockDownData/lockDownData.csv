Spain,"Economists estimate that the government deficit will increase from 2.6% in 2019 to 15% in 2020. These estimates are based on a projection that the tax revenue will fall by €40 billion and GDP will drop 5%.[224] As of 28 March, Goldman Sachs was predicting a double-digit GDP decline for Spain.[225]  The country's financial institutions are in better shape than they were before the 2008–2014 Spanish financial crisis, and exports and trade balance have improved. However, the debt-to-GDP ratio, government deficit, and unemployment are all higher than they were in 2008, leaving the government less room to manoeuver in its response to the crisis.[222] According to an article in El País, house prices in some parts of Spain have seen significant declines, although few sales are occurring due to the lockdown.[226]

United Kingdom,"Initially, Boris Johnson largely kept Britain open, resisting the kind of lockdowns seen elsewhere in Europe. In a speech on 3 February, Johnson's main concern was that the ""coronavirus will trigger a panic and a desire for market segregation that go beyond what is medically rational to the point of doing real and unnecessary economic damage.""[57] On 11 February, a “senior member of the government” told the ITV journalist Robert Peston that ""If there is a pandemic, the peak will be March, April, May” and, further, that “the risk is 60% of the population getting it. With a mortality rate of perhaps just over 1%, we are looking at not far off 500,000 deaths.""[58] On 13 March, UK chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance told BBC Radio 4 that one of ""the key things we need to do"" is to ""build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease and we reduce the transmission"".[59] This involves enough people getting infected, upon which they develop immunity to the disease.[60][61] Vallance said that 60% of the UK's population will need to become infected for herd immunity to be achieved.[62][61] This stance was criticised by experts who said that it would lead to hundreds of thousands deaths and overwhelm the NHS. Over 200 scientists urged the government to rethink the approach in an open letter.[63] Subsequently, Health Secretary Matt Hancock denied that herd immunity was a plan for the UK, and the Department of Health and Social Care said that ""herd immunity is a natural byproduct of an epidemic"".[64] On 4 April, The Times reported that the government's science adviser, Graham Medley, is still advocating a ""herd immunity"" strategy.[65] There was also criticism over a lack of transparency around the scientific evidence being used to inform the government response, with a letter published in the Lancet on 17 March calling on the government to openly share its data and models as a matter of urgency.[66]

On 28 March the editor-in-chief of The Lancet published a condemnation of what he saw as government inaction and ignoring of WHO advice.[153] On 31 March former WHO director Anthony Costello, following WHO advice that countries should ""test, test, test"", said the key to the UK transitioning out of lockdown was mass testing, and that the UK had the capacity to reach the level of testing being carried out by Germany (70,000 tests a day, compared to the UK's 5,000), but that the government and Public Health England (PHE) had been too slow and controlling to organise.[154] The day after, Conservative MP Jeremy Hunt, chair of the Health and Social Care Select Committee and former Health Secretary, said it was ""very worrying"" that the government had not introduced mass testing because doing so had been ""internationally proven as the most effective way of breaking the chain of transmission"".[155] On 2 April, The Telegraph reported that one of the Government's science advisers, Graham Medley, claimed ""mass public testing has never been our strategy for any pandemic."" Medley also stated that the Government ""didn't want to invest millions of pounds into something that is about preparedness.""[156]

United Kingdom,"In a paper, the Imperial team provided detailed forecasts of the potential impacts of the epidemic in the UK and US.[27][172] It details the potential outcomes of an array of 'non-pharmaceutical interventions'. Two potential overall strategies outlined were mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.[27] On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced in a press conference significant changes to the government advice, extending self isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that further measures were likely to be required in the future.[25][172] A paper on 30 March by Imperial estimated that the lockdown would reduce the number of dead from 510,000 to less than 20,000.[173]
