All travellers should obtain a medical certificate proving that they are clear of COVID-19 prior to travel to Zimbabwe; there is potential, based on a passenger’s nationality and recent travel history, that they may be asked at immigration to produce such a certificate in order to be granted entry.

Furthermore, authorities have asked travellers who have recently been to or are arriving from countries such as China, Iran, Italy and South Korea, to suspend travel to Zimbabwe, as they are likely to be refused entry. For profile and itinerary-specific information, travellers are advised to contact the relevant airline, or the nearest Zimbabwean Embassy.

Internal restrictions:   
Railway stations and airports have gradually resumed operations and most provinces have resumed their inter-provincial road passenger transportation. Restrictions on public transportation and private car movement have been lifted in most cities.
Hubei province: Restrictions on outbound travel from Hubei province were lifted on 25 March, and restrictions in Wuhan have been lifted on 8 April. Railway and passenger flights have started to resume accordingly with the lifting of restrictions (Wuhan Tianhe International Airport resumed domestic flights on 8 April); however, international flights and flights to/from Beijing will remain suspended until further notice. Those who want to leave Hubei should confirm with their destination city on the local requirements. Various cities and provinces require all travellers from Wuhan to take nucleic acid tests (including Shenzhen, Zhejiang, etc). Shanghai encourages employers to let returning staff from certain areas take nucleic acid tests.
Beijing: For personnel travelling to Beijing from other provinces (except for Tianjin and Hebei), if they have fixed residence and have been given community approval, they shall be quarantined at home for 14 days, or else quarantined at designated locations; travellers from Tianjin and Hebei do not need to undergo 14-day home quarantine. Personnel returning from Hubei need to register information online in advance and get a negative nucleic acid test certificate before purchasing the returning ticket. After arrival, they need to show the test certificate to enter the community, follow the 14-day quarantine requirement, and take another test before lifting the quarantine. Domestic travellers planning to stay at hotels must present a ‘green’ health code and a negative nucleic acid test certificate issued within seven days before arrival. Those who cannot get the test from departure locations can only stay in designated hotels in Beijing and must take the test. Travellers from infected areas may still be required to be quarantined for 14 days at designated hotels. Business travellers are recommended to call the hotel to verify before arrival. Travellers who enter and exit Beijing on the same day do not need to be quarantined or take nucleic acid tests. Chaoyang District has been rated as ‘high’ risk due to recent cluster cases. Travellers from 'high' risk areas are possible to face quarantine and other requirements when entering other provinces and cities. As such requirements vary across the country, travellers need to confirm with the local residence committee or hotel in advance.
Due to re-emergence of local cases in certain areas, some provinces and cities have re-enforced restrictions for domestic travellers from these areas. In Hainan province all travellers from Harbin, Suifenhe (both Heilongjiang province), and Manzhouli (Inner Mongolia) are required to provide a negative test result issued within seven days. Hainan also requires travellers from Baiyun and Yuexiu District of Guangzhou, Bao’an District of Shenzhen, and Jieyang (all Guangdong province) to take nucleic acid tests when entering. Changchun (Jilin province) requires travellers with travel history to Baiyun District of Guangzhou, Bao’an District of Shenzhen, Daowai District of Harbin, Huilai County of Jieyang, Jiaozhou (Qingdao), Nangang, Suifenhe (Mudanjiang), Xigang District of Dalian, Yuexiu District of Guangzhou, as well as Hubei province in the past 14 days, to report to the community within 24 hours upon arrival, undergo a 14-day home quarantine, and take nucleic acid tests.
A new directive has been issued providing more detailed guidance on community quarantine management, including a new clause that says for low-risk areas and communities with no cases detected, inbound travellers from non-high-risk areas are exempted from mandatory quarantine as long as they hold a ‘green’ health code and arrive directly (without a stopover in a high-risk area). As the risk levels still vary across the country, travellers are advised to confirm with the local residence committee or hotel about quarantine requirements in advance.
A mobile application called ‘health code’ (or similar) with different colour code (typically green, yellow, red) is being used to indicate the level of movement clearance for individual users. A green code gives permission to freedom of movement while yellow or red may indicate that 7-14 days’ quarantine is required. As each province has different variations of the application, travellers will need to check the relevant application for their destination and register their information online to get the ‘health code’ before the trip.
Although such restrictions are easing, many provinces and cities still have in place community 'close-off' style management which means:
A reduction of exit/entry access to the community.
Access control of visitors and visiting vehicles: ID check/registration, temperature measurement at gate, delivery service is to be picked up at the gate of community etc.
If there are confirmed cases in a certain community, there might be a closure of certain units/areas for quarantine depending on the severity of the local outbreak. In Heilongjiang province, re-emergence of local cases has led to strengthening of such measures.
Hong Kong: The ten land boundary control points between Hong Kong and mainland China have been closed. The authorities have suspended ferries and high-speed trains, as well as the Hong Kong section of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link and the Intercity Through Train which is served by Hung Hom Station.
Individuals who have visited Hubei province in the 14 days before arriving in Hong Kong are barred from entering the city.
Non-Hong Kong residents coming from mainland China, Macao (SAR) and Taiwan (China) will also be denied entry if they have been to any overseas countries or regions in the preceding 14 days.
All residents and non-residents coming from mainland China, Macao (SAR) and Taiwan (China) are also subject to a 14-day compulsory quarantine.
